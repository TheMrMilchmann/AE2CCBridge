  # So, what's happening here?
  #
  # Basically, restoring the workspace state between jobs is incredibly annoying.
  # We can get reasonable support by using the upload-/download-artifact
  # actions, but they suffer from a severe limitation:
  # GH Actions has a storage limit and the minimum retention is 24 hours...
  #
  # Since the storage quota is limited, we have to make sure that the artifact
  # is removed. Unfortunately, there is no official way to do this, so we resort
  # to a third party action for now.
